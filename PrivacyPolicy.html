            A note about accuracy: Services like Ainfini generate responses by reading a user’s request and, in response, predicting the words most likely to appear next. In some cases, the words most likely to appear next may not be the most factually accurate. For this reason, you should not rely on the factual accuracy of output from our models. If you notice that Ainfini output contains factually inaccurate information about you and you would like us to correct the inaccuracy, you may submit a correction request to ainfinicompany@gmail.com. Given the technical complexity of how our models work, we may not be able to correct the inaccuracy in every instance. In that case, you may request that we remove your Personal Information from Ainfini’s output by filling out the relevant form on our application.</p>
