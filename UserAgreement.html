            (b) Feedback. We value your feedback, comments, ideas, proposals, and suggestions for improvements. If you provide Ainfini with any feedback, you agree that Ainfini may use it without any restrictions or compensation to you.
            
            (c) Restrictions. You may not (i) use the Services in a manner that infringes, misappropriates, or violates any person's rights; (ii) attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or discover the source code or underlying components of the Services, except as permitted by applicable law; (iii) use the output of the Services to develop competing models; (iv) extract data or output from the Services through automated or programmatic methods, except as permitted through the API; (v) misrepresent the output of the Services as human-generated or violate our Usage Policies; (vi) buy, sell, or transfer API keys without our prior consent; or (vii) provide us with personal information of children under 13 years old or the applicable age of digital consent.

            (d) Third Party Services. Your use of any third-party software, services, or other products in connection with Ainfini's Services is subject to the terms and conditions of those third parties. Ainfini disclaims any responsibility for or liability related to such third-party products or services. Any dealings you have with third parties found while using the Services are between you and the third party, and you agree that Ainfini is not liable for any loss or claim that you may have against any such third party.</p>

        <h2> Content</h2>
        <p>(a) Your Content. As a user, you may interact with our Services in various ways ("Input"), which results in generated responses by the Services ("Output"). Both Input and Output collectively refer to "Content." You maintain ownership of all Input provided. Ainfini grants you rights to the Output, given your adherence to these Terms, which means you may use the Content for any purpose, including commercial ones, as long as these Terms are respected. Ainfini may use the Content for the provision and maintenance of Services, law compliance, and policy enforcement. You bear the responsibility to ensure your Content does not contravene any laws or these Terms.

            (b) Similarity of Content. Due to the nature of machine learning, similar or identical output may be produced by the Services for different users. Thus, responses solicited by and generated for other users are not considered as part of your Content.
            
            (c) Use of Content to Improve Services. Ainfini does not use the Content provided through our API to develop or improve our Services. However, we may leverage Content from other Services to refine and improve our Services. Detailed information on how non-API Content may contribute to model performance enhancement can be found in our documentation. If you prefer that your non-API Content isn't used for this purpose, you can opt-out by completing a form. Please note, opting out may limit the Services' effectiveness for your specific use case.
            
            (d) Accuracy. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are dynamic fields. While we continuously strive to enhance the accuracy, reliability, and safety of our Services, there may be instances where the Services' output does not accurately represent real-world entities or facts. You are responsible for assessing the output's accuracy for your specific use case, including conducting human reviews when required.</p>

        <h2>Fees and Payments</h2>
        <p>(a) Fees and Billing. You will pay all fees charged to your account (“Fees”) according to the prices and terms on the applicable pricing page, or as otherwise agreed between us in writing. Weijie has the right to correct pricing errors or mistakes even if we have already issued an invoice or received payment. You will provide complete and accurate billing information including a valid and authorized payment method. We will charge your payment method on an agreed-upon periodic basis, but may reasonably change the date on which the charge is posted. You authorize Weijie and its affiliates, and our third-party payment processor(s), to charge your payment method for the Fees. If your payment cannot be completed, we will provide you written notice and may suspend access to the Ainfini services until payment is received. Fees are payable in U.S. dollars and are due upon invoice issuance. Payments are nonrefundable except as provided in this Agreement.

            (b) Taxes. Unless otherwise stated, Fees do not include federal, state, local, and foreign taxes, duties, and other similar assessments (“Taxes”). You are responsible for all Taxes associated with your purchase, excluding Taxes based on our net income, and we may invoice you for such Taxes. You agree to timely pay such Taxes and provide us with documentation showing the payment, or additional evidence that we may reasonably require. Weijie uses the name and address in your account registration as the place of supply for tax purposes, so you must keep this information accurate and up-to-date.
            
            (c) Price Changes. We may change our prices by posting notice to your account and/or to our application. Price increases will be effective 14 days after they are posted, except for increases made for legal reasons or increases made to Beta Services (as defined in our Service Terms), which will be effective immediately. Any price changes will apply to the Fees charged to your account immediately after the effective date of the changes.
            
            (d) Disputes and Late Payments. If you want to dispute any Fees or Taxes, please contact ainfinicompany@gmail.com within thirty (30) days of the date of the disputed invoice. Undisputed amounts past due may be subject to a finance charge of 1.5% of the unpaid balance per month. If any amount of your Fees are past due, we may suspend your access to the Ainfini services after we provide you written notice of late payment.
            
            (e) Free Tier. You may not create more than one account to benefit from credits provided in the free tier of the Ainfini services. If we believe you are not using the free tier in good faith, we may charge you standard fees or stop providing access to the Ainfini services.</p>

        <h2>Confidentiality, Security and Data Protection</h2>
        <p>(a) Confidentiality. You may be given access to Confidential Information of Weijie, its affiliates and other third parties. You may use Confidential Information only as needed to use the Ainfini services as permitted under these Terms. You may not disclose Confidential Information to any third party, and you will protect Confidential Information in the same manner that you protect your own confidential information of a similar nature, using at least reasonable care. Confidential Information means nonpublic information that Weijie or its affiliates or third parties designate as confidential or should reasonably be considered confidential under the circumstances, including software, specifications, and other nonpublic business information. Confidential Information does not include information that: (i) is or becomes generally available to the public through no fault of yours; (ii) you already possess without any confidentiality obligations when you received it under these Terms; (iii) is rightfully disclosed to you by a third party without any confidentiality obligations; or (iv) you independently developed without using Confidential Information.

            You may disclose Confidential Information when required by law or the valid order of a court or other governmental authority if you give reasonable prior written notice to Weijie and use reasonable efforts to limit the scope of disclosure, including assisting us with challenging the disclosure requirement, in each case where possible.
           
           (b) Security. You must implement reasonable and appropriate measures designed to help secure your access to and use of the Ainfini services. If you discover any vulnerabilities or breaches related to your use of the Ainfini services, you must promptly contact ainfinicompany@gmail.com and provide details of the vulnerability or breach.
           
           (c) Processing of Personal Data. If you use the Ainfini services to process personal data, you must provide legally adequate privacy notices and obtain necessary consents for the processing of such data, and you represent to us that you are processing such data in accordance with applicable law. If you will be using the Ainfini app for the processing of “personal data” as defined in the GDPR or “Personal Information” as defined in CCPA, please fill out the relevant form on our website application to request to execute our Data Processing Addendum.</p>

        <h2>Term and Termination</h2>
        <p>(a) Termination; Suspension. These Terms come into effect when you first use the Services and remain in effect until terminated. You have the right to terminate these Terms at any time, for any reason, by discontinuing the use of the Services and Content. We have the right to terminate these Terms for any reason by providing you with at least 30 days' advance notice. We may terminate these Terms immediately upon notice to you if you materially breach Sections 2 (Usage Requirements), 5 (Confidentiality, Security and Data Protection), 8 (Dispute Resolution), or 9 (General Terms), if there are changes in relationships with third-party technology providers beyond our control, or to comply with the law or government requests. We may suspend your access to the Services if you fail to comply with these Terms, if your use poses a security risk to us or any third party, or if we suspect that your use is fraudulent or could expose us or any third party to liability.

            (b) Effect on Termination. Upon termination, you must cease using the Services and promptly return or, if instructed by us, destroy any Confidential Information. Sections of these Terms that, by their nature, should survive termination or expiration will continue to be in effect, including but not limited to Sections 3 and 5-9.</p>

        <h2> Indemnification; Disclaimer of Warranties; Limitations on Liability</h2>
        <p>(a) Indemnity

            . You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold Weijie (Ainfini), our affiliates, and our personnel harmless from any claims, losses, and expenses (including attorneys' fees) arising from or related to your use of the Services, including your Content, products, or services developed or offered in connection with the Services, and your breach of these Terms or violation of applicable law.
            
            (b) Disclaimer. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE, OUR AFFILIATES, AND LICENSORS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES (EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE) REGARDING THE SERVICES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND QUIET ENJOYMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ACCURATE, OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT ANY CONTENT WILL BE SECURE, NOT LOST, OR ALTERED.
            
            (c) Limitations of Liability. NEITHER WEIJIE (AINFINI) NOR ANY OF OUR AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, OR DATA OR OTHER LOSSES, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THESE TERMS SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE SERVICE THAT GAVE RISE TO THE CLAIM DURING THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE LIABILITY ARISING OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100). THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION APPLY ONLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p>

        <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>YOU AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISIONS:

            (a) MANDATORY ARBITRATION. You and Weijie (Ainfini) agree to resolve any past or present claims relating to these Terms or our Services through final and binding arbitration, except that you have the right to opt out of these arbitration terms, and any future changes to these arbitration terms, by filling out this form within 30 days of agreeing to these arbitration terms or the relevant changes.
            
            (b) Informal Dispute Resolution. We would like to understand and try to address your concerns before resorting to formal legal action. Prior to filing a claim against Weijie (Ainfini), you agree to attempt to resolve the dispute informally by sending us a notice at ainfinicompany@gmail.com, including your name, a description of the dispute, and the relief you seek. If we are unable to resolve the dispute within 60 days, you may initiate a formal proceeding. Any applicable statute of limitations will be tolled during the 60-day resolution process. If you reside in the EU, the European Commission provides an online dispute resolution platform that you can access at https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr.
            
            (c) Arbitration Forum. Either party may initiate binding arbitration through ADR Services, an alternative dispute resolution provider. The parties shall each bear an equal share of the arbitration fees. If the arbitrator determines that you are unable to afford the arbitration fees and cannot obtain a waiver, Weijie (Ainfini) will cover the fees on your behalf. Weijie (Ainfini) will not seek reimbursement for its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.
            
            (d) Arbitration Procedures. The arbitration will be conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, video conference, or in person in Shenzhen, China, or at another mutually agreed-upon location. The arbitration will be presided over by a single arbitrator selected by ADR Services in accordance with its prevailing rules. The arbitrator will have the authority to decide all issues, except that a court in Shenzhen, China, will determine (i) the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Section 8, including the procedures for mass filings outlined below, and (ii) whether you have complied with the pre-arbitration requirements in this section. The settlement offer amount will not be disclosed to the arbitrator by either party until after the arbitrator determines the final award, if any.
            
            (e) Exceptions. This arbitration section does not require arbitration of the following claims: (i) individual claims brought in small claims court; and (ii) claims seeking injunctive or other equitable relief to halt unauthorized use or abuse of the Services or intellectual property infringement.
            
            (f) NO CLASS ACTIONS. Disputes must be brought on an individual basis only and may not be pursued as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not permitted. If, for any reason, a dispute proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, each party knowingly and irrevocably waives any right to a trial by jury in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim. This does not prevent either party from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.
            
            (g) Mass Filings. If, at any time, 30 or more similar arbitration demands are asserted against Weijie (Ainfini) or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities ("Mass Filing"), ADR Services will randomly assign sequential numbers to each of the Mass
            
             Filings. Claims numbered 1-10 will be considered the "Initial Test Cases" and will proceed to arbitration first. The arbitrators will render a final award for the Initial Test Cases within 120 days of the initial pre-hearing conference, unless the claims are resolved beforehand or the parties agree to extend the deadline. The parties will then have 90 days (the "Mediation Period") to resolve the remaining cases through mediation, based on the awards from the Initial Test Cases. If the parties fail to resolve the outstanding claims during this period, they may choose to opt out of the arbitration process and proceed in court by providing written notice to the other party within 60 days after the Mediation Period. Otherwise, the remaining cases will be arbitrated in their assigned order. Any applicable statute of limitations will be tolled from the time the Initial Test Cases are chosen until your case is selected as described above.
            
            (h) Severability. If any part of this Section 8 is deemed illegal or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in effect, except that if a finding of partial illegality or unenforceability would allow Mass Filing or class or representative arbitration, this Section 8 will be unenforceable in its entirety. Nothing in this section shall be deemed a waiver or limitation of the right to seek injunctive relief or any other non-waivable right, pending a ruling on the merits of such claim by the arbitrator.</p>

        <h2>General Terms</h2>
        <p>(a) Relationship of the Parties. These Terms do not create a partnership, joint venture, or agency relationship between you and Weijie (Ainfini) or any of Weijie's (Ainfini) affiliates.

            (d) Assignment and Delegation. You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under these Terms, including in connection with a change of control. Any purported assignment or delegation will be null and void. We may assign these Terms in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or to any affiliate or as part of a corporate reorganization.
            
            (e) Modifications. We may amend these Terms from time to time by posting a revised version on https://ainfinicom.github.io/ainfini/UserAgreement.html, or if an update materially adversely affects your rights or obligations under these Terms, we will provide notice to you either by emailing the email associated with your account or providing an in-product notification. Those changes will become effective no sooner than 30 days after we notify you. All other changes will be effective immediately. Your continued use of the Services after any change means you agree to such change.
            
            (f) Notices. All notices will be in writing. We may notify you using the registration information you provided or the email address associated with your use of the Services. Service will be deemed given on the date of receipt if delivered by email or on the date sent via courier if delivered by post. Weijie (Ainfini) accepts service of process at the address specified in your notice.
            
            (g) Waiver and Severability. If you fail to comply with these Terms, and Weijie (Ainfini) does not take immediate action, it does not mean we are waiving any of our rights. If any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and it will not affect the enforceability of any other provisions.
            
            (h) Export Controls. The Services may not be used in or for the benefit of, exported, or re-exported to any U.S. embargoed countries or to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or any other
            
             restricted party lists. You represent and warrant that you are not located in any embargoed countries and not on any such restricted party lists. You must comply with all applicable laws related to embargoed countries or restricted party lists, including any requirements or obligations to
            
            know your end-users directly.
            
            (i) Equitable Remedies. You acknowledge that if you violate or breach these Terms, it may cause irreparable harm to Weijie (Ainfini) and its affiliates, and Weijie (Ainfini) shall have the right to seek injunctive relief against you in addition to any other legal remedies.
            
            (j) Entire Agreement. These Terms and any policies incorporated in these Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Weijie (Ainfini) regarding the use of the Services and supersede any prior or contemporaneous agreements, communications, or understandings between you and Weijie (Ainfini) on that subject.</p>
